# effulgence

This is an automatic mirror generator for the RP fic "Effulgence". It is written in Clojure and compiled using Lein.
At present, it is quite buggy.

## Usage

Currently you have to use the REPL and do something like 
(spit TOC.html (apply str (html/emit* (html/select TOCWithUpdatedTags [:div.entry-content])))) and
(dorun (map processChapterURL RemainingTOCURLList)) in order to get it to work.
